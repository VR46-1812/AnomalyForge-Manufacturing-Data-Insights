# **AnomalyForge: Manufacturing Data Insights**  
A project focused on leveraging data analytics to uncover quality issues, identify risks, and provide actionable insights for enhancing manufacturing processes.

---

## **Overview**  
In this project, I worked on a simulated dataset mimicking real-world manufacturing production data. The aim was to analyze quality metrics, identify recurring defects, and mitigate risks through data-driven solutions. By applying advanced statistical techniques and visual analytics, this project showcases the use of data to drive operational improvements.

## **Key Highlights**  
1. **Data Simulation**:  
   - Simulated a dataset of 1,000 batches, including defect counts, downtime hours, and production volumes.  
   - Cleaned and structured the data for robust analysis.  

2. **Visualizations**:  
   - Pareto charts to prioritize defects contributing most to quality issues.  
   - Correlation heatmaps to reveal relationships between downtime, defects, and production.  
   - Control charts for monitoring defect trends and flagging anomalies.  

3. **Statistical Analysis**:  
   - Conducted T-tests to analyze the impact of downtime on defect rates.  
   - Computed key statistical metrics to ensure actionable insights.  

4. **Insights and Recommendations**:  
   - Identified the top defect types contributing to 80% of quality issues.  
   - Suggested strategies for minimizing downtime and improving production consistency.
